Jungle
=====================

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 4.2 to assist in learning Ruby on Rails. 

### Project Features
- Products in the catalogue show a "SOLD OUT" badge if their quantity is zero.
- Adding/removing products and adding categories are permitted only for those with an Admin sign-in
- Users can register for an account and login to their account. If they try to register with an already existing e-mail address they are redirected to the login page. 
- After completion of an order a detailed order page is shown with each item purchased, totals, their e-mail address, and order number.
  - An e-mail version of this is also generated to be sent to their e-mail address.
- Users cannot checkout with an empty cart.
- Once logged in users can review products on a 1-5 scale and leave an optional description. They can also delete their own reviews. The average of a product's reviews are displayed in the catalogue.

 - Front End: HTML, SASS, Bootstrap
